* ETSI EN 300 392-5 V2.7.1 (2020-04): Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA); Voice plus Data (V+D) and Direct Mode Operation (DMO); Part 5: Peripheral Equipment Interface (PEI)

## Restrictions

* store/forward control information is not handled
* not all specified text encoding schemes are implemented
